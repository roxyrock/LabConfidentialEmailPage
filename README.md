# Confidential Email Page

This is a small HTML and CSS project built as part of the CSS curriculum on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This page simulates a **confidential email** using HTML for structure and CSS to mask certain content. It demonstrates use of:

- Box model (with `padding`, `margin`, and `border`)
- `display: inline-block`
- CSS transforms (`rotate`)
- CSS filters (`blur`)
- Semantic HTML elements

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Rotated "CONFIDENTIAL" and "TOP SECRET" labels
- Blurred text spans to simulate redacted information
- Proper box sizing to control layout dimensions

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The goal was to follow project requirements and practice styling and layout techniques:
- Use of `box-sizing: border-box` for accurate layout
- Rotated and styled divs for warning labels
- Masked sensitive text with `filter: blur(3px)`
